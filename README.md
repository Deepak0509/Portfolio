 <b>Description</b>
 
 The website contains some basic information about me. It specifies my skills and interests to the viewer. Required care has been taken
 to make the website compatabile to any screen size. It looks minimal and clean. It has required links for the viewer to get in contact
 with me.

 <b>Problems Faced</b>
 
 As this was the first ever project I made using HTML, CSS it took me time to understand how everything was happening. I faced 
 difficulties in making the navigation bar functionable, aligning the carousel properly and getting the rows and colomns properly
 so that they were compatabile for any screen size.

 <b>Scope of Improvement</b>
 
 As I mentioned above, this was my first project so I went for minimal design and had less animations, transistions. As I learn more 
 I will add more animations and transistions to make the page feel more interactive. Also as I didn't do any projects till now I
 couldn't add anything to the projects page, I am working on few projects, I will add them as soon as I complete them.

 <b>What I have learned</b>
 
 This is the first time I have done something related to Web Development so I have learnt a lot while making the project. I have learnt
 HTML, CSS and how to link Bootstrap to a website.It was a great learning experience as a whole.
